I just played a surprisingly fun Earthbound-style text adventure in ChatGPT. After this, I'm convinced that we are not very far away from (simple) custom games tailor-made to your tastes. It's also quite easy to imagine playing an AI-generated Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

[**Prompt:**](/images/chatgpt/earthbound/1.png) I am playing a text adventure game whose theme is Earthbound, the SNES game. You present me with specific commands to look around my environment and keep track of my inventory. Sometimes, when I look around, I find a useful item for a fight. Randomly when I look around, a monster engages me in a fight. When this happens, you enter fight mode and display an ascii representation of the monster, along with its name and hitpoints. Me and the monster are given options to take turns fighting. To start, I, the player (Ness) wake up in my bedroom. A meteor has just landed in Onett. Whenever there is an option to do something, prompt me with options and then let me respond.

You'll notice that the AI kind of played the game for me for the first few commands.

This is where ChatGPT started to let me take actions myself.

There were definitely some hiccups, but damn, this is already kind of fun.
