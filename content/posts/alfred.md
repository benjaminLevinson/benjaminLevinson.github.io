I've been reading [_The Productive Programmer_](https://www.amazon.com/Productive-Programmer-Theory-Practice-OReilly/dp/0596519788/) for a book club and it's put me on a productivity binge. Looking into some of the tools the author recommends, I stumbled on [**Alfred**](https://alfredapp.com), a Mac productivity app, and it's already revolutionizing how I work.

Alfred basically replaces the Spotlight (try âŒ˜-space if you don't know what that is and you're on Mac), which is a built-in Mac tool to search for files and apps. Alfred takes that concept and turns it into a way to automate and interact with your most-used workflows.
