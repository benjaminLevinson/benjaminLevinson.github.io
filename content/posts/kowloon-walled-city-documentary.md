I stumbled upon this fascinating documentary about a city on the outskirts of Hong Kong that would feel at home in a Jodorowsky graphic novel (particularly the fantastic _The Incal_). [**Kowloon Walled City**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City) was a military fort ceded by the Chinese to the British as part of the colony, then abandoned by British colonials and occupied by pirates and squatters. Later on, it was ruled by an organized crime syndicate called "the triad". It was torn down by the British colonial government in 1994 and turned into a massive park.

Another mesmerizing thing I found was this beautiful infographic that I could stare at for hours.

A photographer took some amazing pictures of the city before it was torn down, which you can find [here](https://bluelotus-gallery.com/kowloon-walled-city). I'd love to buy their photo book...
